# Deep-Learning-
Hand writing detection model 
Mnist data set is used to train the model 
tensorflow lib is used 
accuracy of the model is 98%
P.S: This is a basic model for practice 

# Dataset Information

The data files contain gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine.

Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.
